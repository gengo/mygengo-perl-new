myGengo Perl Library (for the [Gengo API](developers.gengo.com))
========================================================================================================
Translating your tools and products helps people all over the world access them; this is, of course, a
somewhat tricky problem to solve. **[Gengo](gengo.com/)** is a service that offers human-translation
(which is often a higher quality than machine translation), and an API to manage sending in work and watching
jobs. This is a Perl interface to make using the API simpler.
